Just a quick repo to have the mod working for myself on the latest Valheim version (Ashlands).

Probably not the best way to do things but they work.

If you want to compile it yourself just add the reference to the assembly_valheim file not included here and replace the DLL on the downloaded package from https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/KGvalheim/ItemDrawers/
